What is the projected market size & growth rate of the Renal Denervation Market?

Market Analysis and Size

The rising prevalence of hypertension as well as the increasing preference for minimally invasive procedures for treatment have carved the way for the growth of renal denervation products. These provide precisely controlled and targeted Radiofrequency (RF) energy to the renal nerves which disrupt the overactive sympathetic signaling between the kidneys and brain to reduce blood pressure.

The increase in the prevalence of resistant hypertension is leading to an increase in the number of patients seeking treatment along with the rising preference of healthcare providers towards minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of resistant hypertension using renal denervation technique. For instance, according to WHO, around 1.28 billion people aged between 30 and 79 years were affected by hypertension globally in 2021.

An increase in the number of cases of hypertension is expected to create demand for renal denervation devices during the forecast period. Some major reasons for an increase in the prevalence of hypertension are the increasing geriatric population, high sodium and low potassium intake, rising cases of obesity, increasing alcohol consumption in low and middle-income countries, physical inactivity, and the lack of a balanced diet.
