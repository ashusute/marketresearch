Cerebral edema treatment market is expected to gain market growth in the forecast period of 2021-2028. Data Bridge Market Research analyses the market to account to grow at a CAGR of 6% in the above mentioned forecast period.

Cerebral edema is a serious health issue that can occur as a result of a variety of pathogenic processes, including tumour and ischemia. It's a life-threatening condition in which the brain fills with fluid. The pressure inside the skull, known as intracranial pressure (ICP), rises as a result of this fluid. Increased ICP can impair blood flow to the brain and oxygen delivery to the brain. To function properly, the brain requires an uninterrupted supply of oxygen. Brain swelling is another name for cerebral edema.

The rise in the prevalence of cerebral edema, growing number of head injuries, and changing lifestyle are the major factors that will influence the market growth rate. Also, upsurge in the healthcare expenditure and rising initiatives by government as well as private organisations to spread awareness about the disease are the factors that will expand the cerebral edema treatment market. In addition, other factors such as increase in the incidences of ischemic stroke, brain tumor and brain hemorrhage along with the rising geriatric population will cushion the growth rate of cerebral edema treatment market.
