Market Analysis and Size

Cosmetics that are labelled as "halal" are made without any substances that are prohibited by Islamic law. These skincare and beauty products don't include any compounds that might damage the skin or have negative side effects, and they are also vegan-free. Additionally, as materials from animals or genetically modified creatures are prohibited by law, the products are devoid of any such substances.

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the Halal cosmetics market which was USD 49.47 billion in 2022, would rocket up to USD 126.94 billion by 2030, and is expected to undergo a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period. “Personal care” dominates the product segment of the halal cosmetics market because it is free from animal cruelty, clean, and danger.
