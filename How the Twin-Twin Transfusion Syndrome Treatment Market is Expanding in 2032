Data Bridge Market Research report on twin-twin transfusion syndrome treatment market provides analysis and insights regarding the various factors expected to be prevalent throughout the forecast period while providing their impacts on the market’s growth. The increase in the prevalence of rare disease globally is escalating the growth of twin-twin transfusion syndrome treatment market.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) refers to a rare, serious condition caused in pregnancies when identical twins share a placenta. In the placenta, abnormal blood vessel connections are formed, which causes uneven blood flow between the babies. One twin, known as the donor, tends to become dehydrated, and other, called the recipient, develops high blood pressure and produces high level of urine resulting in over-filled amniotic sac.

The increase in the prevalence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome across the globe acts as one of the major factors driving the growth of the twin-twin transfusion syndrome treatment market. The high risk of heart failure because of fluid overload as one of the complications associated with the syndrome, and increase in the use of ultrasound for diagnosing the condition during pregnancies accelerate the market growth. The increase in the need of drugs for treating the complications caused by the syndrome and rise in in the number of acquisition strategies and company collaborations among manufacturers further influence the market. Additionally, increase in the number of births, developments in healthcare infrastructure, rise in population and high investment positively affect the twin-twin transfusion syndrome treatment market. Furthermore, increase in demand for specific novel treatments extend profitable opportunities to the market players in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028.
