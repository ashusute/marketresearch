It can also strip the ends of electric wires so that they can be connected to other wires or terminals. A wire stripper is frequently regarded as an essential tool for professional electricians and other related personnel.

Increasing urbanisation, rising manufacturing output, and increased investments in construction and infrastructure are among the major factors expected to drive target market growth to some extent over the forecast period. Increasing research and development activities, initiatives, and investments to develop and introduce products that would aid in reducing pneumatic stripper operation time and manufacturing costs is expected to drive target market growth.

Furthermore, an increase in investments, rise in the construction and infrastructural activities and an increase in population all have a positive impact on the pneumatic strippers market. Furthermore, technological advancements in agricultural equipment provide profitable opportunities to market players from 2022 to 2029.
