Market Analysis and Insights :

Global Pass-By Noise Testing Market

Pass-by noise testing market is expected to reach USD 1,825.75 million by 2028 witnessing market growth at a rate of 4.90% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Data Bridge Market Research report on pass-by noise testing market provides analysis and insights regarding the various factors expected to be prevalent throughout the forecast period while providing their impacts on the market’s growth.

The pass-by noise is a vehicle noise pollution certification test for passenger cars, motorcycles, and light trucks. Measuring external sound levels in accordance with procedures established by international standards such as ISO 362 is achieved. An open-throttle acceleration test and a constant speed test are included in the test process (only for vehicles with a power-to-mass ratio higher than 25). Since the experiments have to be replicated several times in order to show a consistent average value, with at least four measurements for each side of the vehicle and for each gear, it is important that it is simple to set up and operate the pass-by noise system.

The growing demand for in-vehicle infotainment systems, increasing adoption of stringent government regulations to reduce noise pollution, increasing demand for measurement of vibration and noise from the automotive along with transportation vertical, rising preferences towards the usages of electric and hybrid vehicles along with rising need to measure low level noise, growing noise levels in the environment are some of the major as well as important factors which will likely to accelerate the growth of the pass-by noise testing market in the projected timeframe of 2021-2028.
