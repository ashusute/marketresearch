What is the projected market size & growth rate of the Vacuum Blood Collection Tube Market?

Vacuum blood collection tubes are sterile glass or plastic tubes used to collect blood samples. A vacuum blood collection tube employs a stopper to produce a vacuum seal, allowing blood to be collected directly from the veins. These are used to prevent blood contamination in a variety of settings, including clinics, hospitals, blood banks, pathology laboratories, outpatient centers, and others. According to Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences Research at the universities of Oxford, Bristol and Southampton, between 2000/1 and 2015/16 the number of diagnostic tests ordered per 10,000 person a year increased 3.3 folds from 14,869 to 49,267. This represents an 8.5% increase per year. Such substantial increase in diagnostic testing correlates directly with the rising demand for vacuum blood collection tubes, as more tests necessitate more blood samples. Consequently, the growing volume of diagnostic procedures fuels the expanded use of vacuum blood collection tubes.
