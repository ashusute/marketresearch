Global Renal Denervation Market Overview

One minimally invasive catheter-based treatment for hypertension is renal denervation. Renal artery nerves are burned with radiofrequency ablation. Both blood pressure and nerve activity drop. When pharmacological therapy fails to provide relief, this process is typically employed to improve outcomes. Ultrasound or high-frequency pulses are used to eliminate the nerves in the wall of the renal artery. By lessening the sympathetic kidneys' activity, it reduces blood pressure.
